# Browser-based graphical user interface for AFQ

AFQ-Browser will run in any standard web browser and is designed
to visualize AFQ results.

See: http://viz.afq-browser.org/ for a working example

## Installation

AFQ-Browser requires the [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/),
[scipy](http://scipy.org/scipylib/index.html) and
[pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) libraries. These are all included in the
[Anaconda Python distribution](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/)

AFQ-Browser and its dependencies can also be installed using pip:

    pip install AFQ-Browser


To install AFQ-Browser from source,
[download](https://github.com/yeatmanlab/AFQ-Browser/archive/master.zip) the
source code and run `python setup.py install` in the top-level folder after
extracting it.

## Running AFQ-Browser

After installing the software, you can run the program on mat files generated by
[AFQ](https://github.com/yeatmanlab/AFQ). For an example, download this
[mat file](XXX) and run:

    afqbrowser-assemble afq.mat
    afqbrowser-run

Open a browser pointing to http://localhost:8080, to view the visualization of
these data and to interact with it.
